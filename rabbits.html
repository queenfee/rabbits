            I used to own rabbits until they died

        <p2>Here's my favorite song about rabbits:</p2>

                Little bunny Foo Foo
                <br>
                Hopping through the fores
                <br>
                Scooping up the field mice
                <br>
                and bopping them on the head
                <br>
                Down came the good fairy, and she said
                <br>
                "Little bunny Foo Foo
                <br>
                I dont want to see you

                Scooping up the field mice
                <br>
                And bopping them on the head"
